Q : What is HTTPS ?
-> HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP. It uses SSL/TLS (Secure
Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security) to encrypt the communication between the client and the server.

Q : How HTTPS Transfers Data?
Step-1: Client initiates a connection
When you visit a website like https://example.com, Your browser sends a request to connect to the server
over port 443 (standard for HTTPS).

Step-2: Server responds with SSL certificate
The server sends back its SSL certificate, which includes:
    1. The server's public key
    2. Domain name
    3. Digital signature (signed by a trusted Certificate Authority - CA)

Step-3. Client verifies the certificate
The browser checks:
    * Is the certificate valid?
    * Is it issued by a trusted CA?
    * Is it for the correct domain?
If all checks pass, the browser proceeds.

Step-4. Client generates a symmetric key
The browser creates a symmetric session key (used to encrypt data). This key is encrypted using the server's
public key (from the SSL certificate). The encrypted key is sent to the server.

Step-5. Server decrypts the session key
The server uses its private key to decrypt the symmetric key. Now both the client and server share the same
symmetric key.

Step-6. Encrypted data transfer begins
All communication (e.g., HTTP requests and responses) is now encrypted with the shared symmetric key.
This includes:
    * Login info
    * Form submissions
    * API requests/responses
    * Media content

Step-7. Data is decrypted on arrival
The browser and server each decrypt the received data using the symmetric key. No third party (like a hacker
on the same Wi-Fi) can read the content.
