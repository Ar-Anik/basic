Q : What is a Program?
--> Program is a set of instructions (written code) that a computer can execute to perform a task. When you write Python
code (.py file), that is a program. When you compile or run that code, it becomes an active running program inside your
computer's memory.

-> When your Python script is running (alive in the computer memory), that running instance is called a program (more
technically: a process). Inside that running program, you can have one or more threads. Each thread executes parts of
the code.

# Real-Life Analogy:
    ✅ Restaurant = Program
    ✅ Restaurant Open = Program is Running
    ✅ Waiters = Threads doing work inside the program

* If restaurant is closed, no waiter can work → If the program is not running, no threads can do anything.
* If you have only one waiter, customers are served one by one → Single-threaded: one task at a time.
* If you have many waiters, many customers are served at the same time → Multi-threaded: multiple tasks running concurrently.

-> When the restaurant opens, the first waiter (called Main Thread) automatically starts working. we can later hire
more waiters (create new threads) if needed.


Q : What is process?
--> When run a Python script the operating system (Windows/Linux/Mac) creates a Process. So process is an instance of running program.

# step by step :
1. Our .py file is just static code on disk.
2. We run python app.py.
3. The OS reads the code, loads the interpreter (python.exe), and creates a "Process".
4. This Process is an active living thing (just like an object is an active instance of a class).
5. So,we say: a "running instance" of our program exists now → meaning, it is loaded, it is alive, and it is doing work.

-> So, we can think of a running process as a kind of object created from our program.
