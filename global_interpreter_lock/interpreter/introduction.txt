--> The interpreter is like a kitchen machine (e.g. an oven or robot) that knows how to follow specific instructions (bytecode).

-> Each thread is like a chef who:
    * Has their own recipe (Python function),
    * Needs to use the machine (interpreter) to follow the instructions,
    * Must wait for their turn (because only one chef at a time can use the machine, due to the GIL).

So:
    * The interpreter doesn't manage threads;
    * Threads use the interpreter;
    * The GIL ensures only one thread can use the interpreter at a time.
