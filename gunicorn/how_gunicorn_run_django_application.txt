--> Gunicorn run django application like runserver(web-server)

Q : How Does Gunicorn Run Django App?
1. Django provides a WSGI application object: In our project’s wsgi.py, we’ll see something like:
    from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
    application = get_wsgi_application()

* This application is a callable WSGI app.
* It knows how to receive an HTTP request and return a response.

2. Gunicorn loads that WSGI app:
When we run:  gunicorn myproject.wsgi:application
Gunicorn:
    * Imports our myproject/wsgi.py
    * Calls the application object when a request comes in
    * Manages workers, connections, timeouts, etc.
