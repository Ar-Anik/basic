--> An interpreter is a program that:
	* Reads our code (or compiled bytecode),
	* Understands it
	* And executes it line by line

In Python the interpreter includes:
	* A parser (to analyze source code),
	* A compiler (to turn source code into bytecode),
	* The PVM (which executes that bytecode).

Q : What is Parsing?
Parsing is the step where Python reads our code (the .py file) and breaks it down into a structured form that it
can work with.
	* It checks syntax: Are the statements valid Python?
	* It builds an internal structure, often a syntax tree (AST – Abstract Syntax Tree).
	* This structure is then used to generate bytecode.

Q : What is Python Virtual Machine(PVM) ?
--> The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) is the part of the Python runtime that executes our Python bytecode.  PVM is part of the Python interpreter.

> Python Code Execution Process
When we write and run a (.py) file, Python doesn’t execute our code directly. Instead, the steps are:

Step-1 : Parsing and Compilation
	* First Our (.py) source code is compiled into bytecode (a lower-level, platform-independent representation).
	* This bytecode is saved in (.pyc) files (in the __pycache__ folder).

Step-2 : Execution by the Python Virtual Machine
	* The PVM reads the bytecode and executes it line by line.
	* This is where our program "runs" — in the virtual machine.

Q :  What is Bytecode?
	* It's not machine code (like what a CPU executes).
	* It's not human-readable like Python source code.
	* It's a set of instructions that the PVM understands and interprets.
