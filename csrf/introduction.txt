Q : What is CSRF?
--> CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery. It is a security attack that tricks a user into performing an unwanted action on a website where
    they are already logged in.

# Think of it like this: Imagine you're logged into your bank account in one browser tab, and in another tab, you open a malicious website. That bad
website secretly sends a request to your bank to transfer money—without your permission—but since you're logged in, the bank accepts it.
