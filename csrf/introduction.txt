Q : What is CSRF?
--> CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery. It is a security attack that tricks a user into performing an unwanted action on a website where
    they are already logged in.

# Think of it like this: Imagine you're logged into your bank account in one browser tab, and in another tab, you open a malicious website. That bad
website secretly sends a request to your bank to transfer money—without your permission—but since you're logged in, the bank accepts it.

# How does CSRF work?
1. You log into your bank
-> Your bank sets a session cookie to keep you logged in. Now, any request you send to the bank will automatically include that session cookie.

2. You visit a malicious website
-> This website has a hidden form like:
    <form action="https://yourbank.com/transfer" method="POST">
        <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000">
        <input type="hidden" name="to_account" value="attacker_account">
    </form>

    <script>
        document.forms[0].submit(); // Submits the form automatically
    </script>

3. What happens?
-> Since you're logged into your bank, this malicious form submits with your session cookie, and the bank thinks you made the request.
Then Money transferred to the attacker's account. This is CSRF in action. You're forged into sending a cross-site request.
