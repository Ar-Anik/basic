# Equvalent of Limit and Offset

# This return the first 5 object (Limit 5)
>>> Entry.objects.all()[:5]

# OFFSET 5 LIMIT 5
>>> Entry.objects.all()[5:10]

# Negative indexing (i.e. Entry.objects.all()[-1]) is not supported.

# Return a list of every second object of the first 10:
>>> Entry.objects.all()[:10:2]

# Returns the first Entry in the database, after ordering entries alphabetically by headline:
>>> Entry.objects.order_by("headline")[0]
or
>>> Entry.objects.order_by("headline")[0:1].get()

The first of these will raise IndexError while the second will raise DoesNotExist if no objects match the given criteria.
