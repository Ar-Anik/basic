--> Django middleware primarily follows Chain of Responsibility Pattern

# Chain of Responsibility Pattern : This pattern passes a request through a chain of handlers (middleware
classes), each having a chance to process the request or pass it along.

-> How It Works in Django:
    1. Middleware components are chained together.
    2. Each middleware can:
         * Process the request before the view is called (process_request() or __call__)
         * Process the response after the view is called (process_response())

    Request --> Middleware 1 --> Middleware 2 --> View --> Middleware 2 --> Middleware 1 --> Response

    3. Each middleware in the chain is responsible for:
        * Modifying the request
        * Allowing/denying access
        * Modifying the response on the way back
Example:
    # settings.py
    MIDDLEWARE = [
        'myapp.middleware.MiddlewareOne',
        'myapp.middleware.MiddlewareTwo',
    ]
These are executed in the order defined for requests, and in reverse for responses.

--> Middleware can write in two way :
    1. Class Base
    2. Decorator Base

Both are follow chain of responsibility pattern. function-based middleware (and class-based via __call__)
internally applies the Decorator pattern by wrapping the get_response function to add behavior.
