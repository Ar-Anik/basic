--> Middleware is a small piece of code that runs before or after a request is processed. It helps us add
features like authentication, security checks, or modifying the request/response without changing our main
views.

--> Middleware is a framework of hooks into Django’s request/response processing. It’s a light, low-level
“plugin” system for globally altering Django’s input or output.

# Middleware Actually Does :
1. One middleware should ideally do one specific job. For example: checking if the user is logged in, adding
a custom header to the response, logging requests, etc.
2. Middleware is NOT responsible for fetching data from the database or handling business logic. That’s usually
done in views or models.

# Middleware’s Role:
    1. It processes the request before it reaches the view.
    2. It processes the response after the view sends it.

# Middleware is like a small salesman who gets the product from the wholesaler. He does not create the product
himself. After receiving the product, he adds some labels (like a logo), packaging, or other extras to each
product, and then sells it to the customer. This small salesman adds extra features before and after the product
is delivered (like after sell Attaches a warranty card or return policy, company shopping bag etc).
