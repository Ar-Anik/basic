# static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
--> In development (when DEBUG = True): Django does not serve media files automatically by default. So, to make our
media files (like uploaded images, PDFs, etc.) accessible via URLs during development, we need to add this line:
    from django.conf import settings
    from django.conf.urls.static import static

    urlpatterns = [
        # ... our other URL patterns ...
    ]

    if settings.DEBUG:
        urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

-> This means:
    * Any URL starting with settings.MEDIA_URL (like /media/)
    * Will serve files from the settings.MEDIA_ROOT directory on our server (like /path/to/project/media/)

# In production (when DEBUG = False):
    * Django does not serve media files for us.
    * This line has no effect in production, even if itâ€™s present in urls.py.
    * Instead, in production, media files should be served by a web server like:
        1. Nginx
        2. Apache
        3. Or through a cloud storage/CDN (e.g., Amazon S3)
Our web server or cloud storage will map URLs like /media/filename.jpg to the appropriate file storage location.
