Q: What is a Reverse Relationship?
-> When a ManyToManyField is declared in one model, Django automatically creates a reverse relationship on the
related model — even if the related model does not explicitly declare that relationship. It allows us to traverse
the relationship in the opposite direction.

# In simple terms:
- The model that defines the ManyToManyField has the forward relationship.
- The related model gets the reverse relationship automatically.

# Example :
from django.db import models

class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Group(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    members = models.ManyToManyField(Person)


Here,
- Forward relationship, Group → Person by this relationship we can access `members` like group.members.all()
- Reverse relationship, Person → Group by this relationship we can access `group_set` like person.group_set.all()

Q : How Django Automatically Names the Reverse Relationship?
-> If no custom name is provided, Django automatically generates the reverse accessor name following this rule:
- <lowercase name of the model that has the ManyToManyField>_set

# In the example above:
- The field members is defined in Group.
- Therefore, the reverse name on Person becomes group_set.

So:
group.members.all()    # All persons in the group
person.group_set.all() # All groups where that person is a member


# Customizing the Reverse Relationship with related_name
class Group(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    members = models.ManyToManyField(Person, related_name="groups")

Now the reverse relationship becomes groups instead of group_set. so we can write :
group.members.all()  # same as before
person.groups.all()  # custom reverse name


# Reverse Relationship in ORM
Django automatically uses this reverse name in the ORM query API (.all(), .filter(), .add(), etc.)

# Example ORM usage:
# Forward query
Group.objects.filter(members__name="John")

# Reverse query (using related_name)
Person.objects.filter(groups__name="Music Band")


# If related_name was not defined, the reverse lookup would be:
Person.objects.filter(group_set__name="Music Band")
