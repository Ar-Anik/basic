Q : What is OneToOneField
-> In Django ORM, a OneToOneField is used when we want to create a one-to-one relationship between two models.
That means each record in one table is connected to exactly one record in another table. It works almost like
a ForeignKey with unique=True. However, Django automatically ensures that the relationship stays unique — no
duplicates can exist.

# Syntax
models.OneToOneField(
    to,                     # The related model
    on_delete,              # What happens when related object is deleted
    parent_link=False,      # Used in multi-table inheritance
    limit_choices_to=None,  # Limit available related objects in forms/admin
    related_name=None,      # Reverse access name
    related_query_name=None,# Reverse filter name in ORM queries
    to_field=None,          # Which field on related model to link to
    db_constraint=True,     # Whether to enforce DB-level constraint
    **options               # Other common field options (null, blank, etc.)
)


# to
Specifies the model that this field will relate to. It can be:
    - A model class directly (e.g., Department)
    - A string 'self' (for self-referential relations)
    - A string 'app_label.ModelName' (for deferred models)


# on_delete
Specifies what happens when the related object is deleted. Common options :
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Value                | Description                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| models.CASCADE       | Deletes this object when the related object is deleted. |
| models.SET_NULL      | Sets field to NULL when related object is deleted.      |
| models.PROTECT       | Prevents deletion if there are dependent objects.       |
| models.RESTRICT      | Like PROTECT but newer and more restrictive.            |
| models.SET_DEFAULT   | Sets the field to default value when deleted.           |
| models.DO_NOTHING    | Leaves the reference as-is (unsafe).                    |
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# related_name
Defines the name used to access the reverse relationship. Example :
class Employee(models.Model):
    department = models.OneToOneField(
        Department,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        related_name='employee'
    )

We can now access the employee from a department object like this:
>>> dept = Department.objects.first()
>>> dept.employee.name


# related_query_name
Defines the name used for reverse filtering in ORM queries. Example :
class Employee(models.Model):
    department = models.OneToOneField(
        Department,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        related_query_name='staff'
    )

- Now we can query:
Department.objects.filter(staff__name__icontains="Alice")


# to_field
Specifies which field on the related model should be linked instead of its primary key.
class Department(models.Model):
    code = models.CharField(max_length=10, unique=True)

class Employee(models.Model):
    department = models.OneToOneField(
        Department,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE,
        to_field='code'
    )

# db_constraint
If set to False, Django will not create a database-level constraint for the relationship. Useful in cases
like legacy databases or performance-sensitive applications.
