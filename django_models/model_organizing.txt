-> In Django, by default each app contains a single `models.py` file where all the models are defined. While this works for
small apps, large apps with many models can become hard to maintain. Organizing models in a package is a clean and scalable
solution.

1. Default App Structure
When we create a Django app using: python manage.py startapp myapp

Django creates the following structure:
    myapp/
    ├── admin.py
    ├── apps.py
    ├── models.py   ← All models go here by default
    ├── views.py
    └── ...

# Problem: If the number of models grows, this single file becomes too large and difficult to manage.

2. Organizing Models into a Package
Instead of keeping all models in one file, we can split them into multiple files and create a models package.

Step 1: Delete models.py
Remove the original models.py file in our app:
    myapp/
    └── models.py   ← Delete this

Step 2: Create a models folder
Inside our app, create a folder named models/ and add an empty __init__.py file to make it a Python package.
    myapp/
    ├── models/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── organic.py
    │   └── synthetic.py
    ├── admin.py
    ├── apps.py
    └── views.py

Step 3: Define models in separate files
File : app_name/models/organic.py
from django.db import models
class Person(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

File : app_name/models/synthetic.py
from django.db import models
class Robot(models.Model):
    model_number = models.CharField(max_length=100)

-> Each file should contain related models to keep the structure clean.

Step 4: Import models in __init__.py
Django loads models from app_name.models. So, we must import them in __init__.py:

File : app_name/models/init.py
from .organic import Person
from .synthetic import Robot

Now, Django knows that Person and Robot are part of app_name.models.

Step 5: Using the models
After this setup, models can be used normally:

from myapp.models import Person, Robot
person = Person.objects.create(name="Alice")
robot = Robot.objects.create(model_number="RX-78")


Q : Why Explicit Imports Are Better?
Instead of using : from .models import *
Explicit imports are recommended : from .organic import Person and from .synthetic import Robot

Because of Advantages:
    1. Avoids namespace clutter
    2. Makes code more readable
    3. Works better with linters and IDE autocomplete
    4. Prevents accidental overriding of models with same names
